- About: 
  > In this chapter, we are learning about what is programming. We also introduce to pseudocode and flowchart, which are the methods of problem-solving before creating the codes. Through the chapter, we had learned the first step on creating a codes, which is define the problems and creating a solution in form of pseudocode and flowchart before creating a codes.

- Abouts
  > This chapter introduces us with the basic of C++ Programming. We learned about keywords, operators, comments, and much more. We also learned about how to use these codes in our C++ Programming. Even though it is just a simple codes we had to learned in the chapter, but it is the most crucial step we need to learn in order to sucessfully create a program.

- Abouts: 
  > In this chapter, we delves deeper into the C++ Programming and learned how to create and use a control structure to create a repeat condition and decision-making situation in our programs. As many problems are relatied to repetition and decision-making, control structure is a crucial parts of the programming that we must learn and understand.

- About: 
  > The chapter introduces us on how to create a function in our programs. Function is one of the important chapters that we need to learn as it teaches us on how to create a different groups in our programs.

- Abouts:
  > Array is a variable that can store multiple data with same type. It is important for us to understand array to store large sets of data under a single variable name to avoid confusion occur when using several variables and causing an error.
