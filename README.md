- About: 
  > In this chapter, we are learning about what is programming. We also introduce to pseudocode and flowchart, which are the methods of problem-solving before creating the codes. Through the chapter, we had learned the first step on creating a codes, which is define the problems and creating a solution in form of pseudocode and flowchart before creating a codes.

- Abouts
  > This chapter introduces us with the basic of C++ Programming. We learned about keywords, operators, comments, and much more. We also learned about how to use these codes in our C++ Programming. Even though it is just a simple codes we had to learned in the chapter, but it is the most crucial step we need to learn in order to sucessfully create a program.

\
**3) <ins>Chapter 3: Control Structure**

- Abouts: 
  > In this chapter, we delves deeper into the C++ Programming and learned how to create and use a control structure to create a repeat condition and decision-making situation in our programs. As many problems are relatied to repetition and decision-making, control structure is a crucial parts of the programming that we must learn and understand.

\
**4) <ins>Chapter 4: Function**
\

- About: 
  > The chapter introduces us on how to create a function in our programs. Function is one of the important chapters that we need to learn as it teaches us on how to create a different groups in our programs.

\
\
**5) <ins>Chapter 5: Array**
\

- Abouts:
  > Array is a variable that can store multiple data with same type. It is important for us to understand array to store large sets of data under a single variable name to avoid confusion occur when using several variables and causing an error.

\
**6) <ins>Chapter 6: Input and Output**
\

- About: 
  > The chapter introduce us about the basic of using input and output in C++. At thhe same time, the chapter also taught us the way of exporting information from a file into our C++ coding and how to create output into our output file by using C++.

\
\
**7) <ins>Chapter 7: Pointers**

- About: 
  > In this chapter, we are introduced to pointer and the way of using it in our C++ coding. From my understanding, pointer is used to point the address of a variable and output it. At the same time, we can also use a pointer as an array to store some values.

\
\
**8) <ins>Chapter 8: Data Structure**

- About: 
  > This is the final chapter for our programming technique 1. In this chapter, we have learnt to create our own variable by creating a data structure in our C++. This have simplify our process from declaring each variable in each function by creating a data structure that can use in any variable.

## Reflection
From the Programming Technique 1 course, I have learned programming skills with C++ to solve the problems. Covering a range of programming concepts and tools, from introduction of programming to solving problems through development of C++ program, I have deepened my understanding about programming and how it is essential for our daily life. Through various topics that I learned from the course, I have also learned multiple ways to make my coding program simpler and more efficient. Overall, exploring the course had helped me to develop an ability to create a solution by using programming skills.
